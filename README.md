 
"Honest comment by Nicolemarsh"

I respect the work that went into this, but sign language gloves are a VERY BAD idea. It requires a deaf user (such as myself) to carry around this cumbersome technology, and it does not benefit me whatsoever, only the people who can hear. It does not offer a convenient way to provide a speaking person's reply.

Moreover, deaf people do not s-p-e-l-l e-v-e-r-y w-o-r-d w-e s-a-y. Sign language depends on more than only finger position, it depends on precise arm movements (how far/close to the body, how quickly or slowly, if an action is repeated or not).

Sign language also depends on physical body shifting from one direction to another, and expressions are very significant. If I sign "why" with my eyebrows raised, that means something different than if I sign "why" with my eyebrows furrowed.

It still takes a lot of work to make this function, and I respect that. However, sign language gloves are the last thing any person in the deaf community actually wants or needs, your time is better spent.
